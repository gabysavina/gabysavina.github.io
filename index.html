	Hello everyone, <br> 
	My name is Gabriella Savina Larasati, you can call me Gaby. I was born in Bekasi, especially in Cikarang city at 21st February 2003. Now i'm 17 years old. I have to stay apart with my family because my home is so far from my school, it can take about 2 until 3 hours if you do a round-trip from my house. So that's why i live in boarding house. But my parent always give me some moneys once a week, so don't worry about how to get a money or how can i eat or something else. In my family, i have a big sister. She is already 22 years old and i love her so much.<br>
	I don't know why i choose SMAKBO as my school. Actually, i already know before about SMAKBO, like people said "SMAKBO tuh anak-anak nya pinter" "Susah loh masuk situ, berat soalnya". And that is true, to be honest i feel it until now. But that is own pride :) and now i alreday enjoy it. I love singing so much, also i like playing music instrument and i want to learn more about how to play other music instrument.<br> <img src="idolagaby.jpg"width="300" height="200"> <br>This is a photo with one of actor in drama that already edited by me. His name is Nam Jong Hyuk. Beside i love music, i also like watching movie or drama. So thats why i choose him for edited in my photo. I think that is enough from me. I hope we can be good friends :)
